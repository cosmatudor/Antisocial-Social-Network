# Antisocial Social Network

## Overview
As a Computer Science student's capstone project, Antisocial Social Network is a JavaFX application that showcases the practical application of theoretical concepts learned throughout my coursework. This project is not just a piece of software; it is a representation of my growth as a developer and my grasp of computer science fundamentals.


## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with AES-encrypted passwords.
- **User Interactions**: Send and manage friend requests, echoing real-life social dynamics.
- **Messaging System**: Real-time communication with friends, demonstrating event-driven programming.
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can manage the visibility of their activities, emphasizing the importance of user-centric design.
- **Complex SQL Operations**: Demonstrates the use of advanced SQL for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.


## Implemented Concepts
- **JavaFX**: Used for crafting the Graphical User Interface, providing a practical example of modern Java application development.
- **JDBC**: To interact with a relational database, reinforcing the concepts of Java Database Connectivity.
- **Encryption**: Application of cryptographic techniques to secure user data.
- **Design Patterns & Principles**:
  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: For a well-organized application architecture, separating the logic from the UI.
  - **Observer Pattern**: To update the UI in response to data changes.
  - **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data layer complexities.
- **SOLID Principles**: Showcasing the application of object-oriented design principles for maintainable and extensible code.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management to ensure the application's resilience.


## Academic Value
This project serves as a practical touchpoint for numerous computer science concepts, including:
- Data Structures: Utilization of Java collections to manage user data.
- Algorithms: Implementation of searching and sorting mechanisms for user interactions.
- Systems Programming: Managing resources and database connections effectively.
